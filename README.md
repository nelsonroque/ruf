# ruf - An R Package of random, useful functions

# Current Functions
- iterative reliability | `iterative_reliability()`
- stepwise reliability | `stepwise_reliability()`
- within-person coupling reliability | `wpcr()`

# Roadmap

- visual decomposition of variance from multilevel models
- automation of centering (gmean, imean, imeangmean, gmeanimean)
